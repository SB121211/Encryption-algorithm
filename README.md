# SBENC encryption algorithm
## Overview
A seed-based algorithm to encrypt and decrypt simple messages in text format by assigning ranges of numbers to a single character and also shifting them by random values for a better entropy.

## Features
- Encrypting English strings into random values
- Providing a key to reverse the process in decryption phase
- Decrypting values encrypted with the same algorithm

## Installation
1. Install python3
2. Install dependencies:
`pip install colorama time re random`
3. Download the script:
`git clone https://github.com/SB121211/Encryption-algorithm.git `

## Usage
`python3 SBENC.py`
1. Select your desired action
2. Follow the steps
3. You need to have the provided key for decryption
